    <i>Boundless</i> is an ongoing work combining high fashion aesthetics  wearable technology to create a wearable, programmable LED grid with flexibility coming from linking together the LEDs in the manner of chainmail or jewelry.
    As the project evolved, I began incorporating PCB design as a surface to mount the LEDs on, and eventually, the PCBs as a decorative part of the piece themselves.<i> Boundless</i> demonstrates how it's possible to solve technological and engineering problems with techniques dismissed as crafty or feminine, just as much as it's possible
    to solve aesthetic and fashion problems with electrical elements.
    This project is part of my master's degree thesis at ITP and is still currently ongoing, with iterations of wearable PCB design and a scaled up version of the multi-LED grid still in progress.
