        Kay is a multidisciplinary artist based in Brooklyn, NY. Their body of work explores gender, queerness, and persona as a tool for self-expression through mediums such as performance, costuming, physical computing and creative applications of technology. 
They are currently studying at NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications graduate program and hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Illustration and a minor in Art History from the Maryland Institute College of Art. They’ve shown work at Light Grey Art Lab and the Society of Illustrators, were a 2021 City Artist Corps grant recipient, and have appeared in events at venues such as The Brick, House of Yes, Club Cumming, Soho Playhouse, The Cell, Bizarre, and Chelsea Music Hall.</p><p>
